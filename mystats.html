<h1>Akash Gadiparthi</h1>
<p>I'm a passionate individual with a deep love for cricket and badminton. On the field, I thrive in the world of 
 sports, finding joy in the strategies, teamwork, and camaraderie these games offer. Off the field, I'm equally 
 passionate about coding, where I explore the endless possibilities of technology and programming, constantly 
 seeking to expand my knowledge and create innovative solutions. This balance between physical and intellectual 
 pursuits defines my enthusiasm for life.</p>
<h4>Dhum Biryani</h4>
<p>I likE dhum Biryani because it is made of chicken and it tastes spicy and very tasty with native spices food.</p>
